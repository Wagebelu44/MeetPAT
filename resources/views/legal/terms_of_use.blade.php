<h3>1. The MeetPAT Service</h3>

<p>1.1 The purpose of the MeetPAT service is to allow users to upload their client data into the system, clean and enrich client data, and dashboard such data in order to segment client data into distinct audiences for relevant targeting.</p>
<p>1.2 Once data has been segmented, the system will allow anonymised audiences to be onboarded directly into the users Facebook account in order to generate an audience list from any specified segment of the list.</p>

<p>1.4.2.1 Once data has been enriched, clients will have access to a Dashboard which allows them to filter the data based on a range of criteria, including age, gender, location, etc. in order to build an audience based on those criteria.</p>
<p>1.4.2.2 This audience can be saved in the system for onboarding purposes. The data provider has the ability to download the audience list, but can only download fields which were originally uploaded. All enrichment data remains anonymous.</p>
